### Problem Statement
IdeaLab is a creative workspace at Skidmore College, equipped with various tools such as 3D printers, sewing machines, and craft materials. It serves as a hub for innovation, hosting frequent events to teach students how to use these tools and bring their ideas to life. However, as the space grew, managing events, tracking staff shifts, and providing machine guides became increasingly inefficient. There was no centralized system to display events, track student workers on shift, or provide instant access to usage guides for machines. 

### Proposed Solution
Recognizing these challenges, I proposed developing an **interactive kiosk system** to streamline operations at IdeaLab. The system automates key tasks such as event display, staff check-in, and access to machine guides. This not only reduces manual effort but also enhances the overall user experience for both students and staff.

### Project Overview
The IdeaLab Kiosk is a **custom-built interactive system** running on a Raspberry Pi (8GB RAM) with a Linux operating system. A batch script launches the kiosk mode, opening a Google Chrome instance that serves a web app in full-screen mode with no navigation options. This ensures seamless access to essential information while preventing unintended interruptions.

### Current Features:
1. **Event Display System** - A centralized panel that showcases upcoming events, including descriptions and locations, with automatic periodic slideshows.
2. **Check-In and Check-Out System for Staff** - Displays which student workers are currently on shift, making it easier to manage staffing.
3. **Machine Usage Guides** - Provides students with access to step-by-step guides for using machines, which can also be sent directly to their emails.

### Features in Development:
1. **Machine and Parts Locating System** - An interactive 2D map of IdeaLab, allowing users to locate tools, machines, and parts efficiently.
2. **AI ChatBot (RAG Model)** - A chatbot trained on IdeaLab documentation, acting as a virtual assistant to help students navigate the space and answer common questions.

By leveraging full-stack development expertise, this **first-of-its-kind system at Skidmore College** improves efficiency, accessibility, and user experience at IdeaLab, making it a more functional and engaging workspace.
