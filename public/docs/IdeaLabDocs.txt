Welcome to Skidmore College's IdeaLab â€“ a dynamic hub where creativity, technology, and innovation intersect. 
The IdeaLab is managed by Darren Mendez, a passionate maker and educator who has overseen the lab's evolution since 2019. 
Under his leadership, the lab now serves over 600 students per semester, offering access to a wide range of tools and guided workshops.

ðŸ“¦ 3D Printing:
IdeaLab offers multiple 3D printers including Prusa i3 MK3S+, Ultimaker S3, and the resin-based Anycubic Photon Mono X. 
Students can print using PLA, ABS, or PETG filament after slicing their models in Cura or PrusaSlicer. 
On average, over 1,200 3D prints are completed every semester, contributing to academic projects, art installations, and student-run businesses.
